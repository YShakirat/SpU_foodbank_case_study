## Introduction

This is a power BI project on the need to set up a foodbank at Springforth University(SpU) campus in collaboration with United Nations, Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO). The project is to analyse and derive insights on the justification as to why foodbank should be set up at Sringforth University. 

Food insecurity is an increasingly pressing issue in university campuses, with many students facing inadequate access to food due to financial constraints. This is also true at Springforth University, where a survey of 1200 students showed that nearly two-thirds of the students were facing food insecurity. This report will provide evidence-based justification for the establishment of a foodbank at Springforth University, in order to better address the issue of food insecurity among its student.

## Problem statement

- why foodbank should be set up at Springforth University

## Visualization

The report comprises 6 pages
  1. Gender, age and year of study
  2. Accomodation, financial source and employment status
  3. Students expenditures
  4. Students skipping meals
  5. Students class performance
  6. Food insecurity and GPA
  


### Gender, age and year of study

![](Gender_by_age_and_year_of_study.png)

Out of the 1200 students interviewed during the course of the survey, 719 of them were females across all the age groups which also showed more females dominating from year 1 through the final year except for option 1 and year 5.

## Potential Benefits of Establishing a Foodbank

Establishing a foodbank at Springforth University would provide numerous benefits to students. The most obvious benefit would be to provide immediate access to food for students facing food insecurity. It would also provide an opportunity for students to learn about nutrition and healthy eating habits, as well as provide a space for students to connect with one another and build community. It would also increase students attentiveness and comprehension in class thereby increasing their overall performance and consequently good grades. 


## Conclusion

This report has provided an evidence-based justification for the establishment of a foodbank at Springforth University. The survey results showed that nearly two-thirds of the students surveyed were facing food insecurity. The report also provided an overview of the potential benefits of establishing a foodbank.  With this information, it is clear that establishing a foodbank at Springforth University would be a beneficial and necessary step in addressing food insecurity among its student body.
